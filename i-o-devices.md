hardware interface: Just like a piece of software, hardware must also present some kind of interface that allows the system software to control its operation.

internal structure**:** responsible for implement- ing the abstraction the device presents to the system. Very simple devices will have one or a few hardware chips to implement their functionality; more complex devices will include a simple CPU, some general purpose memory, and other device-specific chips to get their job done.
